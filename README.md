# strict-tsconfig
It is said that to enable strict mode for TypeScript, only `"strict": true` should be added in your project's `tsconfig.json` file. Actually it is not the full truth, there are many more useful additional options and this package enables all of them for an absolute strict mode. SmartRecruitersâ€™ tsconfig contains all strict rules and improves your project type-safety.

## How to use

Choose Readme for your project:

- [TypeScript](packages/strict/README.md)
- [Angular](packages/angular-strict/README.md)
