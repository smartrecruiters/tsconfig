| 4.1        | 4.1             |
| 4.2        | 4.2             |
| 4.3        | 4.3             |
| 4.4        | 4.4             |
| 4.5        | 4.5             |

```
npm i -D git+https://github.com/smartrecruiters/strict-tsconfig.git
```
When typescript in your project wil be updated don't forget to update the package as well, but anyway if there is more suitable the package version for the new version of TS there will be a warning in your terminal.

**Step 2**. Configure typescript in your project:

Just add `"extends": "@tsconfig/strict/tsconfig.json",` in your main `tsconfig` file. It's also possible to override any rule that the package provides by default, for example
```json
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/strict/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowUnusedLabels": false
  }
}
```
